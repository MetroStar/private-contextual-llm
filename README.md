# private-contextual-llm
This repository contains example code to go along with this [blog post](https://blog.metrostar.com/keeping-large-language-model-conversations-private?hs_preview=PBqyEwHH-160871547526). This code contains all of the resources to launch and run an example workflow of using an LLM to maintain context with individual users while keeping that context private from other users. 

Check out the complete example in the [notebook](restaurant-example.ipynb).

This solution leverages [txtai](https://github.com/neuml/txtai) and [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index).  The rest of the requirements can be found in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
